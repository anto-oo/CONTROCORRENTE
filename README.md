Ehi!

This repo contains the website and some extra content made for the school list CONTROCORRENTE. The project was commissioned by [@giuseppeesepe](https://www.instagram.com/giuseppeesepe/), one among my fellow students at [Liceo Rummo, BN](www.liceorummo.edu.it). The project originally started in March '25, and is still undergoing continuous improvements and modifications.

## Thanks

So, my true appretiation goes to Giuseppe, who believed in me and trusted me for the management of the digital side of his project, preferring a full "made in rummo" (and free) project in spite of a traditional professionally made project (who knows, maybe it was better for both of us...).

I also have to thank Irene, who not only trusted me for the technical aspect of her amazing graphics (the logo is also from her!), but also made me a completely new person, under lots of aspects.

Thank you both!
